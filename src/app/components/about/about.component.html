          experience in this field, I have developed strong skills in <span class="underline">customer service, sales, and marketing</span>, 
          learning the importance of user-friendly environments and strong relationships.

        <p class="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed text-gray-700 drop-shadow-md">
          I focus on crafting <span class="text-purple-700 font-extrabold">dynamic, high-performance</span> websites using the latest technologies. 
          Currently, I am enhancing my skills by
